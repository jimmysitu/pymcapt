Python Interface for McPAT
====


## Example Scripts
- origin.py: the original mcpat, but main function written in python. This script can be use to cross check with the origin C++ mcpat, to make sure everything works all right with SWIG in Python


## TODO
- Add example file for gem5 status.txt to mcpat power
- Add computeEnergy infterface to each compoment which support status changes at runtime
